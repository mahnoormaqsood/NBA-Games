# NBA-Games

##### Two games had anomalous data: "nbagame0021400022" and "nbagame0021400041"
##### The reason for the big box was because there was some error in recording - and instead of getting the next value
##### in the quarter, there was a sudden jump to the initial value, and hence a box was drawn to that point
